## Requirements Document: Logistics Analytical Platform

### 1. Overview
ACME Delivery Services has experienced a significant increase in demand, impacting its ability to efficiently plan operations, particularly in storage management. To address this, a new platform is required to provide Logistics leaders with real-time monitoring of orders and their details. The platform must ensure low latency between the orders system and the analytical platform.

### 2. Objectives

- Enable logistics leaders to monitor created orders and their details in close to real-time.
- Ensure low latency between the operational order system and the analytical platform.
- Provide a logical data model to support business queries.
- Facilitate historical data and real-time data analysis.

### 3. Functional Requirements

- The platform must ingest and process millions of records efficiently.
- It must support querying of both historical and current order data.
- A logical data model must be able to answer business question.
- The system should allow real-time updates and low-latency access to order data.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: The platform must handle high throughput with minimal latency.
- Scalability: Must be capable of scaling horizontally to accommodate future data growth.
- Availability: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance to minimize downtime.
- Usability: Provide an intuitive interface for logistics leaders to access and analyze data effectively.

### 5. Data Requirements

- The platform should integrate data from the orders system.
- Data should be structured to facilitate analytical queries.
- A historical record of order statuses must be maintained for trend analysis.

### 6. Technical Considerations

Use of real-time data streaming and processing technologies.

Implementation of an optimized data warehouse or data lake for storage and analytics.

Adoption of indexing and caching mechanisms for faster querying.

###  7. Success Criteria

- Orders and their details must be available for monitoring with minimal delay.
- Queries should return results within an acceptable performance threshold.
- The system should be able to handle increasing data volumes without degradation.
- Business queries should be easily answered through the logical data model.

### 8. Constraints & Assumptions

- Assumptions are made to be made on latency as it is not stated how often they want the data refreshed
